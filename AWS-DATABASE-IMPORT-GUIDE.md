### 📦 Current Database Contents:

#### **Categories (2 categories):**
1. **Books** - General books category

## 🗄️ Database Files Ready for AWS:

### **PostgreSQL Version (Current):**
- `current-database-export.sql` - Your exact current database

### **MySQL Version (For AWS RDS):**
- `your-current-database-mysql.sql` - Converted for AWS RDS MySQL

## 🚀 AWS RDS Import Instructions:

### **Step 1: Create RDS MySQL Instance**
```bash
# In AWS Console:
# - Engine: MySQL 8.0
# - Instance: db.t3.micro
# - Storage: 20 GB
# - Username: admin
# - Password: [your secure password]
```

### **Step 2: Import Your Database**
```bash
# Connect to your RDS instance:
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com -u admin -p

# Create database:
CREATE DATABASE innovanceorbit;
USE innovanceorbit;

# Import your data:
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com -u admin -p innovanceorbit < your-current-database-mysql.sql
```

### **Step 3: Verify Import**
```sql
-- Check your data was imported:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM categories;  -- Should return 2
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;    -- Should return 1
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;       -- Should return 1 (admin)
SELECT * FROM site_settings;      -- Should show your logo and settings
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration for AWS:

Update your `.env` file with AWS RDS connection:

```bash
# AWS RDS MySQL Connection
DATABASE_URL=mysql://admin:your_password@your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com:3306/innovanceorbit

# Or individual settings:
DB_HOST=your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_NAME=innovanceorbit

# Keep your other settings:
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
MICROSOFT365_EMAIL_USER=your_email
MICROSOFT365_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```
